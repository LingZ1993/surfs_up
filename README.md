## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to compare and see the statistics of temperatures in June and December, trying to see how big is the difference between temperatures in June and December from 2010 to 2017. 

## Results
As we can see from the results: 
1. The average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit, while in December the average temperature is 71.04 degrees; Not really that big of a difference I'd say. 
2. The lowest temperature in June is 64 degrees while in December is 56 degrees; 
3. The highest temperature in June is 85 degrees and in December the highest is 83 degrees.

## Summary
From the results we can know that the temperature in this place is really not that different between Summer and winter, of course I've been to Hawaii several times and I know that it is super nice in winter there. 
Using this data we can see the weather pattern by looking at the statistics and a whole lot other stats.
